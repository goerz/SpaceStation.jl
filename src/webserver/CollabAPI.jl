###
# The collab HTTP API: how external tools (coding agents, scripts, CI) talk to a LIVE SpaceStation server.
#
# Design constraints (deliberate):
#  - Plain HTTP + the existing Pluto secret for auth (`?secret=...` or cookie) — curl-able from
#    any terminal, no protocol stack, no registration. Works for any tool that can run curl.
#  - Input via query parameters, output as JSON (`format=json`, default) or plain text
#    (`format=text`) — so a thin shell client needs no JSON parser at all.
#  - Server discovery via a connection file (like Jupyter's kernel-*.json): every running server
#    writes `$XDG_STATE_HOME/pluto/servers/<node>-<port>.json` with its port and secret (the <node>
#    prefix keeps servers on a shared $HOME — one per HPC node — from colliding; see collab_registry_path).
#  - Runs are BLOCKING: the HTTP response is held open until the cells finish, so a client gets
#    success/failure from one request. Runs go through the same execution path (and the same
#    execution token) as browser clients — both sides see each other's runs live.

The shell command that opens a notebook's embedded package environment in an interactive Julia

`Pluto.activate_notebook_environment` copies the notebook's embedded project + manifest into a temp

back into the `.jl`. This builds the invocation rather than shipping a fixed string because the
notebook must be opened by *this* server's Julia and from an environment where SpaceStation is
importable, neither of which the browser can know.

The notebook does NOT have to be shut down first, unlike upstream Pluto: lazy mode keeps the file
watcher running (`SessionActions.jl`), so an environment written here is picked up by
`update_from_file` within about a second and surfaces as Pluto's "restart required" banner. What
still races is a *simultaneous* full-file write from both sides, hence the note the REPL prints.

outside `/ws`. `splitpath` is what knows the platform: on Windows it splits on `\\` as well as `/`
and keeps the drive or UNC share as one component, while on unix a `\\` is an ordinary character in
a filename and stays one. The sidebar's paths are Windows-separated on Windows — `tamepath` is

"""
Listing of a workspace folder as JSON-able pairs, depth- and entry-budgeted. Bulky tool directories

`depth=0` lists just this folder, which is what the hub's lazy sidebar asks for — one folder per
request, only for folders the user has actually opened. Deeper values pre-walk the tree in one
response; nothing in the hub needs that any more, but `/api/v1/workspace?depth=N` still offers it
for scripts that want the whole shape at once.

The walk is **breadth-first**: every entry of a folder — directories AND files — is listed before
anything descends into a subfolder. A depth-first walk lets one fat subdirectory spend the whole
budget before its siblings, or even its parent's files, are looked at; a workspace containing a
`.venv` then showed two folders in the sidebar and nothing else. Level-by-level, the shallow
entries a person actually wants are the ones that fit in the budget.

A folder the budget stopped short of ends with a `"truncated"` marker entry, so the frontend can
say "not listed" instead of quietly showing a short — or empty — folder.

Once the budget is spent the walk stops immediately: the folders still queued are marked unlisted
without being read at all. This endpoint is polled every 10s by every open hub tab, so an
exhausted budget must cost nothing more, not one `readdir` per folder it declined to list.
